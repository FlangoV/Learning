Exercise 5: Write a program to read through the mail box data and
when you find line that starts with “From”, you will split the line
into words using the split function. We are interested in who sent
the message, which is the second word on the From line.

You will parse the From line and print out the second word for each
From line, then you will also count the number of From (not From:)
lines and print out a count at the end. This is a good sample output
with a few lines removed:

python fromcount.py
Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
louis@media.berkeley.edu
zqian@umich.edu

[...some output removed...]

ray@media.berkeley.edu
cwen@iupui.edu

Create a list .
Create a for loop, analysing every line inside of read_file.
Create another for loop, analysing especifically a line of
specific criteria inside of the first loop.
